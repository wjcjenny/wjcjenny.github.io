											<p>This an Applied Visual Science Lab project. I and my team developed an explanatory graphics and video about the effects of oil spills in Gulf Mexico on the health of deep water fish by using the real marine research paper, “Deep-water Horizon crude oil impacts the developing hearts of large predatory pelagic fish (PNAS)”.</p>
											<p>A little over five years ago, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico released more than 636 million litres of crude oil. </p>
											<p>The oiled covered spawning areas for many commercially and ecologically important fishes. Accordingly, the impacts of the oil on the development of fishes was a major concern. To investigate this, researchers studied the impacts of field-collected Deepwater Horizon (MC252) oil samples on embryo development of bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna and amberjack fishes.</p>

									<p>I began this project in Data-Mining the City class with my teammate by asking simple questions about how big data, iterative processing, and critical visual studies could help us to see the forces subtending our cities.</p>
									<p>We began our research in Dongguan, a city between Shenzhen to its south and Guangzhou to its north in China. Known for its light industries, Dongguan is more relaxed than its neighbours as tech hub and capital cities respectively.</p>
									<p>The slow life, however, belies a vast and complex network of relationships. While those relationships are never hidden from sight, they operate with tacit consent, under pseudonyms, and without the explicit regulation of the law.</p>
									<p>We first want to mainly focus on the latent grey industry in Dongguan, so we choose a hotel as origin place which is very famous for this service, and we set a time limit from 9pm to 4am, our assumption is that people who check-in during this very late time and at this place have a large possibility that they are prostitute’s client, so the places that these clients linking to might have interesting relationship with this hotel.</p>
									<p>But after a test we find that this single place will not give us a good result, so we change origin place to Houjie, a larger area full of this service instead only a hotel, which gives us very good result. From the final map, we could see that Houjie has a strong relationship with Hong Kong, Macau and Guangzhou, certain small cities also emerge such as Foshan, Jiangmen and Zhaoqing.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, we could see that Houjie have a really big service radius across the whole pan-prd region(PRD). We then extended this methodology to the whole PRD region, so actually you could move to anywhere you want to examine, and then press the update button, it will send the lat/lng data back to server to show the result.</p>

													<h3>Scandal in the First Minor Road Driving Test After the New Traffic Regulations</h3>
													<p class="gray">Shanghai, By Reporter Jiachuan Wu, January 10, 2013</p>
													<p>English version | <a href="img/article1.jpg" target="_blank">Chinese version</a></p>

								</div>

								<div class="row  slide-open-item">
									<p class="col-xs-12"><br>On the very first day of testing after new traffic regulations were implemented, it was revealed that a testing office instructor was helping students pass their test for 400 Yuan per person（nearly 65 dollars）. After contacting the test offices at #95 Longshui South Road yesterday, an employee admitted that there had been cheating, but the testing office was already investigating the involved party — Chenghao Driving School. The instructor in question has already had his classes cancelled and teaching license suspended.</p>
									<p class="col-xs-12">How could cheating take place if cameras and walls surround the test site? Did nobody hear the instructor coaching his students? Was the instructor the only involved party? Why is bribery such a persistent problem? Read on to find these answers.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">Instructor Coaches Students From Atop Ladder</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Faced with the difficulties presented by the new regulation test, driving in reverse without stopping, and the new traffic safety test, the young Ms. Cao was worried. What if she couldn’t pass? Looking online, she discovered how she could hire a coach to help her pass the test for just 400 Yuan. She wanted an easy way out, but she had her doubts. “How can you cheat with all those cameras?” She wondered. According to sources, out of the 20-odd test-takers, half passed. Some students reported that there was an instructor in the testing offices who would help them passes the test for 400 Yuan. One woman stated that she had failed the test due to not reacting quickly enough when parking on a hill. Another male student said that he had failed because he couldn’t hear the instructor. Neither needed to pay their instructor for failing.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Yesterday, Mr. A (pseudonym), an employee of the only driving school (Chenghao Driving School) associated with the #95 Longshui South Road test offices, reported his experience. He confirmed the cheating that was going on, saying, “Our driving school is linked to the test offices, as mandated by the Administration of Motor Vehicles and Drivers. Our school’s students are the only ones who test here.”</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">In an answer to the question of how one could cheat in an area filled with cameras, Mr. A said that there were many opportunities for an instructor. “This instructor who got caught,” he said, “climbed up a ladder he put up against the wall, and shouted to his students from where he could see them. He told his students when they should turn the steering wheel when backing into a parking space and how far they should turn the wheel, among other things.” He also said that there were gaps in what the test site’s cameras saw. He revealed two of the most commonly used tricks: the first involved students putting their instructor on speakerphone and receiving instructions; the second was for an instructor to climb above the walls and shout instructions to their students.</p>
	           						<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">The Matter has Been Handled</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">The instructor that was caught was using the latter method. But why weren’t the walls of the test site equipped with infrared cameras? According to Mr. A, since this area is scheduled as a relocation project by the municipal government, and will be moving in March or April, no one has been willing to invest in the installation of cameras.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Aside from the move, this test site had an entrance on the intersections of Yunjin Road and Fenggu Road. But after the Longteng Tunnel was built, the tunnel divided the test site into two parts. Mr. A lamented, “We were forced to build a rear entrance on Longshui South Road, and have instructors drive students in to take their tests, otherwise they would end up walking for 20 minutes.” But it was the unfettered access that the instructors’ vehicles had to the test site that gave them opportunity.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“There is an empty lot that the real estate company is going to develop outside of our test site. It’s not within our scope of surveillance. The test site is like a barren island, and instructors can climb onto the wall with a ladder to guide students.” Mr. A said that these were the actions were those of the individual, and that instructor had charged 400 Yuan to each student. Currently, the driving school is investigating the matter, and the instructor has had his classes cancelled and teaching license suspended.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">Why is Bribery Such a Problem? Mutual needs of students and instructors.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Faced with the myriad methods of bribery, Mr. A’s analysis is three-fold. “First of all,” he says, “the students are anxious to get their licenses, so they’re willing to pay. Second of all, since instructors’ income and bonuses are proportional to the number of students who pass, students who fail the test will directly affect instructors’ income. Finally, some instructors who have grown familiar with this way of making money use it to earn extra income.”</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">Lack of Standardization in the Industry</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Reports say that currently, Shanghai has over 270 driving schools with over 30 test sites. The vicious competition between the schools is also a major reason for bribery. Mr. A also commented, saying, “In schools today, the faster they get the students through the courses, the better. Instructors try to get students’ money as quickly as possible in order to make more money. They cram four students into one car. The faster they can get them licenses, the more new students they can get.” In his opinion, bribery can increase the rate of success in the tests, and also the inflow of new students.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">He went on to say that in the driving school industry, in order to attract more students, they have to lower their tuitions. If one school’s tuition is 4,800, another school will lower theirs to 4,200. That’s already a very low price, so in order to make money, they take bribes from students, or even blackmail them. Affiliated employees described this incident as a loophole in the industry. If all of the driving schools had standardized management, and the instructors had standardized pay, this wouldn’t be a problem. The instructor involved was not an official employee of Chenghao Driving School. Many schools have a system, which allows individuals to buy franchise rights for 100,000 Yuan, after which they can teach students. Mr. A did the calculations, and supposing 4,500 Yuan per student, enfranchised instructors only needed to pay schools 2,000 Yuan. The rest (minus insurance and gas) was pure profit for the instructor. He went on to joke, “To a certain extent, we work for them. We can’t manage our bosses."</p>

													<h3>Tangchuan Route Cancels All Stops</h3>
													<p>Shanghai, By Reporter Jiachuan Wu, July 18, 2012</p>
													<p>English version | <a href="img/article2.jpg" target="_blank">Chinese version</a></p>
												</div>

								</div>
								<div class="row  slide-open-item">
									<p class="col-xs-12"><br>“That’s right, it was right here! You stood right here back then, right?”</p>
									<p class="col-xs-12">“Yup! But I don’t think there was any concrete here before. I used to go to the ferry from here.”</p>
									<p class="col-xs-12">Yesterday, as two residents of Chuansha, a small town far away from the downtown of Shanghai, China,  Mrs. Pan and Mr. Zhao, stood at the Tangchuan route’s final stop, they were filled with memories of all that had passed. With the shutting down of several stops along the Tangchuan route (now known as Pudong No.12), including all stops between Chuansha Central District to Sunqiao Area, yesterday became a day of commemoration as Chuansha residents like Mrs. Pan and her husband came to the Tangchuan route.</p>
									<p class="col-xs-12">They wanted to take one last trip on the bus they had taken all their lives, and catch one more glimpse of the new face of Chuansha’s old city district. They wanted to hear the local driver call out the stops on this bus that had taken many Chuansha residents “into the city”, and let the wave of memories wash over them.</p>

	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">Chuansha Residents Take One More Ride: A 35-cent Love Story</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“In the past, we used to be loyal fans of the Tangchuan route. If it wasn’t for this line, we wouldn’t have started dating. We wouldn’t have gotten married, and we wouldn’t have the life we have today. In my mind, the Tangchuan route was like our matchmaker.”</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Yesterday morning, Mrs. Pan decided to forego the subway and her car to take the Tangchuan route with her husband, and once again experience what they call their 35-cent love story. Mrs. Pan was originally a Chuansha native, and although she now lives in Tangqiao, when she found out that the Tangchuan route was officially closing its stops in the Chuansha region, she told a story about her unique fondness of the Tangchuan route.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">She recalled how when she lived in Chuansha, the Tangchuan route was the only route out of the area. “My husband lived in Jiading,” she said, “and we met in the middle, at the Tangqiao docks.” Most of the places she met her husband for their past dates were near the final stop of the Tangchuan route, something which she remembers as if it were yesterday. “The roads weren’t as flat back then, nor were they asphalt. They didn’t have the barriers we have today. After my date, there were a lot of people at the stop waiting to get on the bus. Sometimes I couldn’t make my way on, and had to wait for the next bus. I spent 35 cents every time I went to Tangqiao to see him,” Mr. Pan explained, with sweetness in her voice as she thought back to the early days of their love.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Mr. Zhao added with a smile, “The first time that I went to visit her parents, I took two bottles of Maotai from Jiading to Chuansha, but I was so excited to see her when I got off that I broke one of the bottles. To this day, I remember how that bus smelled of alcohol.”</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“We used to live far away from each other. We couldn’t get a taxi to see each other, like people do now!” Mrs. Pan and Mr. Zhao smiled as they talked about their past. In their minds, urbanization might soon take away this old bus line, but it can never alter the beautiful memories that they have of it.</p>
	            					
	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">The Only Line Into the City Witnessed Chuansha’s Urbanization</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“In the past, people said that Chuansha was in the countryside. We only had the Tangchuan route and Huchuan line to go into the city. But now they are disappearing,” said the 80-year-old Chuansha resident, Mr. Lin. As he spoke, he studied a route map, as he recalled memories of decades past. According to Mr. Lin, the Tangchuan route has witnessed the urbanization of Chuansha. Despite the other routes that were added, the subway opening up, and even the Tangchuan route’s name changing, in the minds of Chuansha residents, the Tangchuan route is still the best.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“20 years ago, everyone still had to take the ferry to go to Puxi, but we’ve only had the Tangqiao ferry dock recently. The Tangchuan route took Chuansha residents to the Tangqiao ferry dock, and everyone rushed onto the ferry to head to the City God Temple for some fun,” Mr. Lin recalled. In the 1980s, Chuansha only had buses to Nanhui County, Zhoupu Town, and Fengxian’s Farm 54. Chuansha didn’t have a bus with a route in Chuansha itself. All the buses went from the Chuansha transport hub to other places.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">In the 1990s, Shenhua buses were brought into Chuansha, and it was only afterwards that more buses began to head to more places, like towns in Pudong. Mr. Lin said that these buses were “flexible, mobile, and could be waved down.”“During the Shanghai Expo, Chuansha finally got a subway, and we could reach the city in minutes. Throughout all the changes to Chuansha’s public transportation, the Tangchuan route has always stood strong. It has suffered, and even had its name changed in March, but “the Tangchuan route” remains the best in the minds of locals.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Mr. Tang, a driver who drove the Tangchuan route for 18 years, shares many of the same thoughts as Mr. Lin. During this route adjustment, one of the 14 buses was reassigned to another route, meaning that one driver was forced to leave the route they had been driving for years. Pudong’s Jingao Public Transportation Co. Manager Mr. Zhang, responsible for the Tangchuan route, said during an interview that this driver was Mr. Tang, who had been driving the route for 18 years. In a follow-up interview yesterday, Mr. Tang said, “I’m counting down the number of trips on this route today. Tomorrow, I’m going to have to start driving another route.” In the rest area of the Tangqiao terminal, Mr. Tang lit up a cigarette as he looked out the window. After quite a few minutes, he said softly, “It’s been over 10 years. I know those 42 stops like the back of my hand. I’ve only got two more runs. This route has witnessed the history of development here.”</p>

	            					<p class="col-xs-12 subtitle">Traffic During Peak Hours: Make Stop Reduction Imperative</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">In response to the lingering memories and reluctance from drivers and passengers about the stop reductions, Jingao Public Transportation Co. explained the reductions from an operational and planning perspective, saying, “Many Chuansha residents have fond memories of this route, but its daily operating income has reduced 40%. In some respects, this shows that people prefer taking the subway. Additionally, removing the Chuansha route is actually because of the severe traffic along this route. Our investigation has found that this is actually because there are too many overlapping routes, and traffic is jam-packed during peak hours.”</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">Aside from the traffic, Mr. Zhang also said that re-allocating the Pudong 12 route would provide better access to the people near Sunqiao (and Shi Village). “There are massive numbers of residents going from Shi Village (the new start of this route) to Zhangjiang. Our routes cover the major roads in Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, so we will focus on the area between Sunqiao and Zhangjiang.” Pudong’s public transportation’s networkization plan this year shows that the Pudong 12 route will officially reduce its stops with the first trip today, and will begin from the intersection of Zhongke Road and Sunhuan Road (instead of the Chuansha transport hub). All stops from Chuansha Central District to Sunqiao have been removed, and the final stop has changed from the intersection of Longyang Road and Pudong South Road to Dongfang Road and Lancun Road. The route has been reduced from 25 km to 15 km, and is only one-way.</p>

									<p class="col-xs-12">Mrs. Zhang said she is now looking for legal aids from lawyer. “I want nothing but an official apology!” She reminded that the only thing she argued with the attendant at that time was where to put her carry-on baggage, “I want to put my bag on the rack just above the head, but the attendant try to move it to the front baggage rack.”</p>

									<p class="col-xs-12">“I have to pay extra 1100 dollars to purchase two tickets! That’s ridiculous! ” Mrs. Zhang believed this discriminative action is unacceptable to anyone who bought tickets.

This action made the rest of the passengers surprise and some of them try to plea captain change his mind. However, they failed.</p>
	            					<p class="col-xs-12">“That’s unbelievable! How could the captain left Zhang’s daughter alone in the cabin! She is only 12, even unable to read the safety instruction by herself… ”</p>
